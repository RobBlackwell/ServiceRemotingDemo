# Service Bus Remoting Demo

This is a really simple to understand example of remoting a service using Service Bus. Bare bones, easy to follow code.

Server provides a simple service that add two numbers. The service is remoted upto an endpoint in the Windows Azure Service Bus.

Note that the client does not need to authenticate (although we could have chosen otherwise).

Try running multiple servers - they are effectively sticky session load balanced.

Try running multiple clients.
